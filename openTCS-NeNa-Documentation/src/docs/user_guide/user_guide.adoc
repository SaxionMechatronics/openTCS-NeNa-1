= User Guide

The end-user is expected to have basic knowledge of ROS2 and OpenTCS. This chapter only describes how to use the driver, but not how OpenTCS or ROS2 works. 

[[setup]]
[[anchor]]Setup
---------------

NOTE: The setup has only been tested with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and ROS
Dashing Diademata and with the
http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_setup/[TurtleBot3]
robot.

[[prerequisites]]
[[anchor-1]]1. Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Install ROS2 Dashing, see instructions https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Dashing/Linux-Install-Debians/[here].
- Install the Turtlebot 3 environment for ROS2 dashing, see instructions 
(http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_setup/[here]).
- It is *mandatory* to have Gradle v5.x installed. Newer or older Gradle versions may cause problems. You can check your current Gradle version using a linux command: `gradle -v`. Gradle v5.6.4 can be downloaded on the https://gradle.org/releases/[Gradle Releases] page.
- it is *mandatory* to have JDK 8 installed. Newer JDK editions do not work with OpenTCS 4.17. Oracle JDK and OpenJDK both work. Make sure that *both* you Java executor (`java`) and Java compiler (`javac`) are set to JDK 8. 
      * Check your Java executor with (`java -version`) and Java compiler (`javac -version`). Both should return version 8 or version 1.8.x.
      * If you have a different Java version, you should install JDK 8 and set the default Java version (instructions https://askubuntu.com/questions/121654/how-to-set-default-java-version[here]).

- If you want to use the OpenTCS-ROS2 driver with a Turtlebot 3 Simulation, follow the setup guides for the https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_simulation/#turtlebot3-simulation-using-gazebo[Turtlebot 3 Simulation with Gazebo]. It is crucial that that the robot supports Navigation2 and ROS2 default positioning channels such as `amcl_pose`. If you just follow the https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_simulation/#turtlebot3-simulation-using-gazebo[simulation guide], it should be all good.

[[setup_rcljava]]
[[anchor-2]]2. Setup RCLJava
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OpenTCS-ROS2 driver requires to have functional rcljava build. https://github.com/ros2-java/ros2_java/tree/dashing[RCLJava] is the Java client for ROS2. This software *MUST* be built on your local machine since it depends on machine-specific system files.

Download the Ament repositories in a ROS2 workspace. They are needed to build RCLJava
```
mkdir -p ~/rcljava/ament_ws/src
cd ~/rcljava/ament_ws
curl -skL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/esteve/ament_java/master/ament_java.repos -o ament_java.repos
vcs import src < ament_java.repos
src/ament/ament_tools/scripts/ament.py build --symlink-install --isolated
```

Once we setup the build tool, we can download and build RCLJava:

```
mkdir -p ~/rcljava/ros2_java_ws/src
cd ~/rcljava/ros2_java_ws
curl -skL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros2-java/ros2_java/dashing/ros2_java_desktop.repos -o ros2_java_desktop.repos
vcs import src < ros2_java_desktop.repos
. ../ament_ws/install_isolated/local_setup.sh
ament build --symlink-install --isolated --skip-packages example_interfaces

```
Now we add RCLJava to the `.bashrc` so each terminal instance will be have a RCLJava sourced:
```
gedit ~/.bashrc
```
Append the following two lines to the end of the file:
```
source ~/rcljava/ament_ws/install_isolated/local_setup.bash
source ~/rcljava/ros2_java_ws/install_isolated/local_setup.bash

```
Save the `.bashrc` file, and restart the terminal to apply the changes.

[[setup_opentcs]]
[[anchor-2]]3. Setup OpenTCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the openTCS-NeNa source code:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nielstiben/openTCS-NeNa.git
```
*Very important!* Specify the _RCLJava workspace_ in `openTCS-NeNa-CommAdapter-ROS2/build.gradle`. Change the directory to ROS2-java workspace on `your` machine. If you followed the steps above, it should look like this. Don't forget to change the `USER` placeholder:
```
cd openTCS-NeNa
gedit ./openTCS-NeNa-CommAdapter-ROS2/build.gradle
```
./openTCS-NeNa-CommAdapter-ROS2/build.gradle:
```
// ================== Set HERE your Ros2-Java workspace path. ==================
String ros2JavaPath = '/home/USER/rcljava/ros2_java_ws/'
// =============================================================================
```
Build the project using Gradle:
```
cd ~/openTCS-NeNa
gradle distZip
```
The OpenTCS with ROS2 driver is now built. You can find a _distribution package_ at `~/openTCS-NeNa/build/distributions/`. 

[[usage-with-example-project]]
[[anchor-5]]Usage With Example Project
-------------------------------------

The ROS2-driver is a multi-purpose driver and can (technically) be used
for any ROS2-vehicle. This usage guide is made and tested for a
simulated TurteBot3, but can also be applied to other (similar) robots.

1.  Start a gazebo simulation with: TurteBot3 World
(http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_simulation/#turtlebot3-simulation-using-gazebo[how-to]).
2.  Generate SLAM maps in the simulated TurtleBot3 World
(http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_slam/#run-teleoperation-node[how-to]).
3.  Start Navigation in RViz with the map you created in Step 2.
(http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_navigation2/#ros-2-navigation2[how-to]).
4.  Set the initial position of the TurteBot3
(http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/ros2_navigation2/#estimate-initial-pose[how-to]),
this could also be done in the Kernel Control Center Panel.

Now our simulation with Gazebo and RViz with navigation has been
started, we are ready to use the OpenTCS.

1.  In the setup (see above), a distribution package is generated. Extract the distribution package to a location of choice on your local machine:
    a. `unzip -d ~/ ~/openTCS-NeNa/build/distributions/openTCS-NeNa-<version>-bin.zip` (Change the <version> placeholder!).
2.  Start the OpenTCS Kernel
    a. Open terminal: `CTRL + ALT + T`
    b. Change working directory to OpenTCS Kernel: `cd ~/openTCS-NeNa-<version>-bin/openTCS-NeNa-<version>-bin/openTCS-NeNa-Kernel/` (Change the <version> placeholder!).
    c. Start kernel: `sh startKernel.sh`
3.  Start the OpenTCS Plant Overview:
    a. Open new terminal (`CTRL + ALT + T`)
    b. Change working directory to OpenTCS Plant Overview: `cd ~/openTCS-NeNa-<version>-bin/openTCS-NeNa-PlantOverview/` (Change the <version> placeholder!).
    c. Start PlantOverview: `sh startPlantOverview.sh`
4.  In the Plant Overview, load the Turtlebot3 Example Project
    a. `File`-> `Load Model...` (CTRL + L).
    b.  Look for the following file that is included in the code source base: `openTCS-NeNa-Documentation/src/docs/turtlebot3_world_example_plant/example_model_scaled.xml`. If you found it, open it!
5.  Persist the loaded model to the OpenTCS Kernel: `File`-> `Persist model in the kernel` (ALT + P).
6.  Switch the Plant Overview to ‘operating mode’: `File`-> `Mode`-> `Operating mode` (ALT + O).
7.  Start the OpenTCS Kernel Control Center. Don't close the Kernel and Plant Overview!
    a. Open new terminal (`CTRL + ALT + T`)
    b. Change working directory to OpenTCS Kernel Control Center: `cd ~/openTCS-NeNa-<version>-bin/openTCS-NeNa-KernelControlCenter/` (Change the <version> placeholder!).
    c. Start kernel: `sh startKernelControlCenter.sh`
8.  On the upper tab, select `Vehicle Driver`
9.  Double click on the first vehicle in the list (‘Bus1’) and open the ‘ROS2 Options’ panel.
10.  Enable the driver. You can specify a custom namespace if you have multiple ROS2 robot instances. If you only have one robot, you can leave it empty.
11.  The AGV is now ready to be used. You can test it by pushing the
‘Dispatch to coordinate’ button.
12.  The final step you need to do, is to update the plant coordinates. Each point in your plant (e.g. `point_enschede`) has has a coordinate that specifies the _real world_ location of that point. 
    a. Go back to the Plant Overview that you started in step 3. Do *NOT* close the Kernel or the Kernel Control Center!
    b. Switch the Plant Overview to ‘modelling mode’: `File`-> `Mode`-> `Modelling mode` (ALT + M).
    c. Click on the grey bullet icon that has label '_point almelo_'. This icon can be found on the big map (a.k.a. plant overview), it is the plant's upper-left point and has two black arrows pointing towards it.
    d. Set the real-world position (in meters) in the `x-position` and `y-position` boxes. These boxes are visible on the _Properties_ pane on the left.
    e. Repeat the above two steps for each point in the model. All points (e.g. `point_enschede`, `point_hengelo`) should have coordinates that can physically be reached by the TurtleBot3.
    d. Once all coordinates are set, the model is ready to be used! You can now, for instance, https://www.opentcs.org/docs/4.17/user/opentcs-users-guide.html#_creating_a_transport_order[create a transport order].
